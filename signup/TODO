Jason this is for you to do. I have added the response page with a button back to the selected registration form.
I still need setup a fresh copy of Zurmo. It will be great if you can help me to setup it up.

* LOGIN PAGE
    * Add a source drop down. (Table, Bible Study) Check the spelling is the same as Zurmo source value.
    * Save the source value in $_SESSION and pass it to $source in register.php
    * Remove the source hidden field in the registration form. 
 
* RESPONSE PAGE.
    * Make the response message look better.
    * Make the button look nicer.
